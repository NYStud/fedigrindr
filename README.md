# Fedigrindr
A project to create a location-based federated social app to actively destroy Grindr monopoly over the LGBTQI+ community

# Introduction

I hate Grindr with a burning passion and I think our social lives shouldn't be on the hands of a private company. There needs to be a federated, owned by no one, open-source, ad-free SPACE for us to meet other LOCAL people. Right?
